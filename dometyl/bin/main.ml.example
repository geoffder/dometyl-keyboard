(* NOTE: If you aren't using hotswap holders, you can simply mirror the generated case stl,
   but if you are, you will need to make a left-hand case like so. The bottom plate and
   tenting base will of course still be reversible, so you can mirror those in your slicer
   as you would a case with plain switch holes. *)
